requests-cache
---------------

Requests-cache is a transparent cache for requests_ library with
persistence and async support

Just write::

    import requests
    import request_cache
    request_cache.configure()

And requests to resources will be cached for faster repeated access::

    for i in range(10):
        r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/redirect/5')
    # will took  approximately 5 seconds instead 50

It can be useful when you are writing some data scraper,
and changing parsing algorithms by trials and errors
